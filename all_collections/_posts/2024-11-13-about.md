After finishing high school and some college, I spent time teaching at a private preschool located in Dallas. Not feeling fulfilled, I enrolled in an Esthetician program at a community college. I knew I loved makeup, but was surprised to have immediately fallen in love with waxing as well. I look forward to continuing to help others feel beautiful and confident in their daily lives. If you want to know more about my professional experience, I have a page dedicated to this [here](/posts/resume/index.html).
